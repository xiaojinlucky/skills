## Summary

Impute reference expression into query cells with TransferData, merge reference and query cells, and compute PCA/UMAP on the shared expression space. The current implementation mirrors the Seurat ATAC integration vignette for ATAC query and RNA reference.

## Signature

```text
RunCoEmbedding( srt, reference, assay = NULL, reference_assay = NULL, reference_reduction = "pca", reference_dims = 1:30, gene_activity_assay = "ACTIVITY", weight_reduction = NULL, dims = 2:30, genes_use = NULL, imputed_assay = "RNA", modality_col = "modality", coembed_prefix = "CoEmbed", npcs = 30, umap_dims = 1:30, k.weight = 100, verbose = TRUE, seed = 11 )
```

## Parameters

- `srt`: A Seurat object.
- `reference`: RNA reference Seurat object used for label transfer.
- `assay`: Which assay to use. If NULL, the default assay of the Seurat object will be used. When the object also contains ChromatinAssay, the default assay and additional ChromatinAssay will be preprocessed sequentially.
- `reference_assay`: Assay used in the reference object.
- `reference_reduction`: Reduction used in the reference object.
- `reference_dims`: Dimensions used from the reference reduction.
- `gene_activity_assay`: Name of the gene activity assay used for mapping.
- `weight_reduction`: Reduction in srt used to weight transferred labels. If NULL, an ATAC linear reduction is resolved automatically from ATAC_default_linear_reduction, {\{prefix\}lsi}, {\{prefix\}svd}, or the current default reduction.
- `dims`: Query reduction dimensions used by TransferData.
- `genes_use`: Genes/features used for expression imputation and co-embedding. If NULL, reference variable features are used.
- `imputed_assay`: Assay name for imputed RNA expression in ATAC cells.
- `modality_col`: Metadata column storing RNA/ATAC origin after merge.
- `coembed_prefix`: Prefix for co-embedding reductions.
- `npcs`: Number of PCs to compute.
- `umap_dims`: PC dimensions used for UMAP.
- `k.weight`: Number of neighbors used when weighting transfer anchors.
- `verbose`: Whether to print the message. Default is TRUE.
- `seed`: Random seed used for UMAP.

## Usage

```text
RunCoEmbedding( srt, reference, assay = NULL, reference_assay = NULL, reference_reduction = "pca", reference_dims = 1:30, gene_activity_assay = "ACTIVITY", weight_reduction = NULL, dims = 2:30, genes_use = NULL, imputed_assay = "RNA", modality_col = "modality", coembed_prefix = "CoEmbed", npcs = 30, umap_dims = 1:30, k.weight = 100, verbose = TRUE, seed = 11 )
```

## Description

Impute reference expression into query cells with TransferData, merge reference and query cells, and compute PCA/UMAP on the shared expression space. The current implementation mirrors the Seurat ATAC integration vignette for ATAC query and RNA reference.

## Value

A merged Seurat object containing RNA reference and ATAC query cells.

## Examples

```r
data(pbmcmultiome_sub)
pbmcmultiome_sub <- RunStandardWorkflow(
  pbmcmultiome_sub,
  assay = c("RNA", "peaks"),
  linear_reduction_dims = 20
)
coembed <- RunCoEmbedding(
  srt = pbmcmultiome_sub,
  reference = pbmcmultiome_sub,
  assay = "peaks",
  reference_assay = "RNA",
  gene_activity_assay = "RNA",
  reference_reduction = "RNApca",
  reference_dims = 1:10,
  dims = 2:10,
  umap_dims = 1:10
)

CellDimPlot(
  coembed,
  group.by = c("modality", "CellType"),
  xlab = "CoEmbedUMAP_1",
  ylab = "CoEmbedUMAP_2"
)
```
