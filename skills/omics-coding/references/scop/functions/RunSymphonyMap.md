## Summary

Single-cell reference mapping with Symphony method

## Signature

```text
RunSymphonyMap( srt_query, srt_ref, query_assay = NULL, ref_assay = srt_ref[[ref_pca]]@assay.used, ref_pca = NULL, ref_harmony = NULL, ref_umap = NULL, ref_group = NULL, projection_method = c("model", "knn"), nn_method = NULL, k = 30, distance_metric = "cosine", vote_fun = "mean", verbose = TRUE )
```

## Parameters

- `srt_query`: An object of class Seurat to be annotated with cell types.
- `srt_ref`: A Seurat object or count matrix representing the reference object. If provided, the similarities will be calculated between cells from the query and reference objects. If not provided, the similarities will be calculated within the query object.
- `query_assay`: The assay to use for the query object. If not provided, the default assay of the query object will be used.
- `ref_assay`: The assay to use for the reference object. If not provided, the default assay of the reference object will be used.
- `ref_pca`: The PCA reduction in the reference object to use for calculating the distance metric.
- `ref_harmony`: The Harmony reduction in the reference object to use for calculating the distance metric.
- `ref_umap`: A character string specifying the name of the UMAP reduction in the reference object. If not provided, the first UMAP reduction found in the reference object will be used.
- `ref_group`: The grouping variable in the reference object. This variable will be used to group cells in the heatmap columns. If not provided, all cells will be treated as one group.
- `projection_method`: A character string specifying the projection method to use. Options are "model" and "knn". If "model" is selected, the function will try to use a pre-trained UMAP model in the reference object for projection. If "knn" is selected, the function will directly find the nearest neighbors using the distance metric.
- `nn_method`: A character string specifying the nearest neighbor search method to use. Options are "raw", "annoy", and "rann". If "raw" is selected, the function will use the brute-force method to find the nearest neighbors. If "annoy" is selected, the function will use the Annoy library for approximate nearest neighbor search. If "rann" is selected, the function will use the RANN library for approximate nearest neighbor search. If not provided, the function will choose the search method based on the size of the query and reference datasets. For finite dense inputs using cosine or Euclidean distance, the raw path uses a bounded-memory compiled top-k kernel unless the full distance matrix is requested. Other metrics and sparse inputs retain the existing proxyC path.
- `k`: A number of nearest neighbors to find for each cell in the query object.
- `distance_metric`: The distance metric to use for calculating the pairwise distances between cells. Options include: "pearson", "spearman", "cosine", "correlation", "jaccard", "ejaccard", "dice", "edice", "hamman", "simple matching", and "faith". Additional distance metrics can also be used, such as "euclidean", "manhattan", "hamming", etc.
- `vote_fun`: A character string specifying the function to be used for aggregating the nearest neighbors in the reference object. Options are "mean", "median", "sum", "min", "max", "sd", "var", etc. If not provided, the default is "mean".
- `verbose`: Whether to print the message. Default is TRUE.

## Description

Single-cell reference mapping with Symphony method

## Examples

```r
data(panc8_sub)
panc8_sub <- RunStandardWorkflow(panc8_sub)
srt_ref <- panc8_sub[, panc8_sub$tech != "fluidigmc1"]
srt_query <- panc8_sub[, panc8_sub$tech == "fluidigmc1"]
srt_ref <- RunIntegration(
  srt_ref,
  batch = "tech",
  integration_method = "Harmony"
)
CellDimPlot(srt_ref, group.by = c("celltype", "tech"))

# Projection
srt_query <- RunSymphonyMap(
  srt_query = srt_query,
  srt_ref = srt_ref,
  ref_pca = "Harmonypca",
  ref_harmony = "Harmony",
  ref_umap = "HarmonyUMAP2D"
)
ProjectionPlot(
  srt_query = srt_query,
  srt_ref = srt_ref,
  query_group = "celltype",
  ref_group = "celltype"
)
