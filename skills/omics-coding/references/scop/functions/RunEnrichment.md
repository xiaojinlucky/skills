## Signature

RunEnrichment( srt = NULL, group.by = NULL, test.use = "wilcox", DE_threshold = "avg_log2FC > 0 & p_val_adj < 0.05", geneID = NULL, geneID_groups = NULL, geneID_exclude = NULL, IDtype = "symbol", result_IDtype = "symbol", backend = c("cpp", "r"), species = "Homo_sapiens", db = "GO_BP", db_update = FALSE, db_version = "latest", db_combine = FALSE, convert_species = TRUE, Ensembl_version = NULL, mirror = NULL, features = NULL, TERM2GENE = NULL, TERM2NAME = NULL, minGSSize = 10, maxGSSize = 500, unlimited_db = c("Chromosome", "GeneType", "TF", "Enzyme", "CSPA"), GO_simplify = FALSE, GO_simplify_cutoff = "p.adjust < 0.05", simplify_method = "Wang", simplify_similarityCutoff = 0.7, cores = 1, verbose = TRUE, ... )
```

## Parameters

- `srt`: A Seurat object or SummarizedExperiment object containing the results of differential expression analysis ({[=RunDEtest]{RunDEtest()}}). If specified, the genes and groups will be extracted from the object automatically. If not specified, the geneID and geneID_groups arguments must be provided.
- `group.by`: Name of one or more meta.data columns to group (color) cells by.
- `test.use`: A character vector specifying the test to be used in differential expression analysis. This argument is only used if srt is specified.
- `DE_threshold`: A character vector specifying the filter condition for differential expression analysis. This argument is only used if srt is specified.
- `geneID`: A character vector specifying the gene IDs.
- `geneID_groups`: A factor vector specifying the group labels for each gene.
- `geneID_exclude`: A character vector specifying the gene IDs to be excluded from the analysis.
- `IDtype`: A character vector specifying the type of gene IDs in the srt object or geneID argument. This argument is used to convert the gene IDs to a different type if IDtype is different from result_IDtype.
- `result_IDtype`: A character vector specifying the desired type of gene ID to be used in the output. This argument is used to convert the gene IDs from IDtype to result_IDtype.
- `backend`: Enrichment backend. "cpp" is the default and uses a fast native hypergeometric ORA implementation and returns the enrichment table without enrichResult objects. "r" uses {[clusterProfiler:enricher]{clusterProfiler::enricher()}} and returns enrichResult objects in results. GO_simplify = TRUE currently uses the R backend.
- `species`: A character vector specifying the species for which the gene annotation databases should be prepared. Can be "Homo_sapiens" or "Mus_musculus".
- `db`: A character vector specifying the annotation sources to be included in the gene annotation databases. Can be one or more of "GO", "GO_BP", "GO_CC", "GO_MF", "KEGG", "WikiPathway", "Reactome", "CORUM", "MP", "DO", "HPO", "PFAM", "CSPA", "Surfaceome", "SPRomeDB", "VerSeDa", "TFLink", "hTFtarget", "TRRUST", "JASPAR", "ENCODE", "MSigDB", "CellTalk", "CellChat", "Chromosome", "GeneType", "Enzyme", "TF", "CytoTRACE2". MSigDB subcollections can be requested as "MSigDB_<collection>", such as "MSigDB_H" for human Hallmark and "MSigDB_MH" for mouse Hallmark. Note: "CytoTRACE2" is species-independent and downloads pre-trained model data required by RunCytoTRACE.
- `db_update`: Whether the gene annotation databases should be forcefully updated. If set to FALSE, the function will attempt to load the cached databases instead. Default is FALSE.
- `db_version`: A character vector specifying the version of the gene annotation databases to be retrieved. Default is "latest".
- `db_combine`: Whether to combine multiple databases into one. If TRUE, all database specified by db will be combined as one named "Combined".
- `convert_species`: Whether to use a species-converted database when the annotation is missing for the specified species. Default is TRUE.
- `Ensembl_version`: An integer specifying the Ensembl version. Default is NULL. If NULL, the latest version will be used.
- `mirror`: Specify an Ensembl mirror to connect to. The valid options here are "www", "uswest", "useast", "asia".
- `features`: A named list of feature lists for custom enrichment gene sets. If provided, it takes precedence over TERM2GENE and db.
- `TERM2GENE`: A data frame specifying the gene-term mapping for a custom database. The first column should contain the term IDs, and the second column should contain the gene IDs.
- `TERM2NAME`: A data frame specifying the term-name mapping for a custom database. The first column should contain the term IDs, and the second column should contain the corresponding term names.
- `minGSSize`: The minimum size of a gene set to be considered in the enrichment analysis.
- `maxGSSize`: The maximum size of a gene set to be considered in the enrichment analysis.
- `unlimited_db`: A character vector specifying the names of databases that do not have size restrictions.
- `GO_simplify`: Whether to simplify the GO terms. If TRUE, additional results with simplified GO terms will be returned.
- `GO_simplify_cutoff`: A character vector specifying the filter condition for simplification of GO terms. This argument is only used if GO_simplify is TRUE.
- `simplify_method`: A character vector specifying the method to be used for simplification of GO terms. This argument is only used if GO_simplify is TRUE.
- `simplify_similarityCutoff`: The similarity cutoff for simplification of GO terms. This argument is only used if GO_simplify is TRUE.
- `cores`: The number of worker processes to use for parallelization. Default is 1.
- `verbose`: Whether to print the message. Default is TRUE.
- `...`: Passed to other functions.

RunEnrichment( srt = NULL, group.by = NULL, test.use = "wilcox", DE_threshold = "avg_log2FC > 0 & p_val_adj < 0.05", geneID = NULL, geneID_groups = NULL, geneID_exclude = NULL, IDtype = "symbol", result_IDtype = "symbol", backend = c("cpp", "r"), species = "Homo_sapiens", db = "GO_BP", db_update = FALSE, db_version = "latest", db_combine = FALSE, convert_species = TRUE, Ensembl_version = NULL, mirror = NULL, features = NULL, TERM2GENE = NULL, TERM2NAME = NULL, minGSSize = 10, maxGSSize = 500, unlimited_db = c("Chromosome", "GeneType", "TF", "Enzyme", "CSPA"), GO_simplify = FALSE, GO_simplify_cutoff = "p.adjust < 0.05", simplify_method = "Wang", simplify_similarityCutoff = 0.7, cores = 1, verbose = TRUE, ... )

## Description

Perform the enrichment analysis (over-representation) on the genes

## Value

If input is a Seurat object, returns the modified Seurat object with the enrichment result stored in the tools slot. If input is a geneID vector with or without geneID_groups, return the enrichment result directly. Enrichment result is a list with the following component: enrichment: A data.frame containing all enrichment results. results: A list of enrichResult objects from the DOSE package. geneMap: A data.frame containing the ID mapping table for input gene IDs. input: A data.frame containing the input gene IDs and gene ID groups. DE_threshold: A specific threshold for differential expression analysis (only returned if input is a Seurat object).

## Examples

```r
term2gene <- data.frame(
  Term = c(
    rep("Endocrine markers", 5),
    rep("Exocrine markers", 5),
    rep("Ductal markers", 5)
  ),
  symbol = c(
    "INS", "GCG", "SST", "IAPP", "PCSK1",
    "PRSS1", "CPA1", "CELA3A", "REG1A", "CTRB1",
    "KRT19", "SOX9", "MUC1", "CFTR", "KRT7"
  )
)
gene_groups <- rep(c("Cluster1", "Cluster2"), each = 6)
enrich_out <- RunEnrichment(
  geneID = c(
    "INS", "GCG", "SST", "IAPP", "PRSS1", "CPA1",
    "KRT19", "SOX9", "MUC1", "CFTR", "KRT7", "REG1A"
  ),
  geneID_groups = gene_groups,
  TERM2GENE = term2gene,
  minGSSize = 2
)
EnrichmentPlot(
  res = enrich_out,
  db = "custom",
  plot_type = "comparison"
)
```
