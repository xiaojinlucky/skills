## Summary

Run scOMM on shared features between a reference object and a query object, write predicted labels and class scores into query metadata, and optionally evaluate predictions against a truth label.

## Signature

```text
RunscOMM( srt, reference, reference_assay = NULL, query_assay = NULL, reference_label = NULL, features = NULL, prediction_prefix = "scomm_", evaluate = FALSE, truth_col = NULL, tool_name = "scOMM", rare_threshold = 0.05, scomm_python = NULL, scomm_hidden_nodes = c(128, 64), scomm_epochs = 10, scomm_batch_size = 32, scomm_threshold = 0.5, scomm_seed = 11, verbose = TRUE )
```

## Parameters

- `srt`: A Seurat object.
- `reference`: Reference Seurat object used for supervision.
- `reference_assay`: Assay used in the reference object.
- `query_assay`: Assay used in the query object.
- `reference_label`: Metadata column in the reference used as supervision labels.
- `features`: Shared features passed to scOMM. If NULL, reference variable features are used.
- `prediction_prefix`: Prefix added to prediction metadata columns. The default creates scomm_prediction, scomm_score.<class>, and scomm_score.max.
- `evaluate`: Whether to compute prediction metrics against a truth label.
- `truth_col`: Metadata column in srt used as the truth label when evaluate = TRUE.
- `tool_name`: Name used to store detailed results in srt@tools.
- `rare_threshold`: Maximum class proportion used to define rare classes when calculating rare_recall.
- `scomm_python`: Optional Python binary used by the scOMM backend. If NULL, SCOP_SCOMM_PYTHON is consulted and reticulate defaults are used otherwise.
- `scomm_hidden_nodes, scomm_epochs, scomm_batch_size, scomm_threshold, scomm_seed`: Parameters passed to the scOMM backend.
- `verbose`: Whether to print the message. Default is TRUE.

## Description

Run scOMM on shared features between a reference object and a query object, write predicted labels and class scores into query metadata, and optionally evaluate predictions against a truth label.

## Value

A Seurat object with scOMM predictions stored in metadata and tools.

## Examples

```r
\dontrun{
data("pbmcmultiome_sub", package = "scop")
pbmcmultiome_sub <- RunStandardWorkflow(pbmcmultiome_sub, assay = "RNA")
ref_cells <- colnames(pbmcmultiome_sub)[1:250]
query_cells <- colnames(pbmcmultiome_sub)[251:500]
reference <- subset(pbmcmultiome_sub, cells = ref_cells)
query <- subset(pbmcmultiome_sub, cells = query_cells)
query <- RunscOMM(
  srt = query,
  reference = reference,
  reference_assay = "RNA",
  query_assay = "RNA",
  reference_label = "CellType",
  scomm_epochs = 1
)
CellDimPlot(
  query,
  group.by = c(
    "CellType",
    "scomm_prediction"
  ),
  xlab = "UMAP_1",
  ylab = "UMAP_2"
)

FeatureDimPlot(
  query,
  features = c(
    "scomm_score.B",
    "scomm_score.max"
  ),
  xlab = "UMAP_1",
  ylab = "UMAP_2"
)
}
```
