## Summary

Build an approximate eRegulon result from paired RNA and chromatin assays. The C++ workflow is not an exact re-run of the official SCENIC+ Python workflow and requires explicit opt-in.

```

## Parameters

- `srt`: A Seurat object containing RNA and chromatin assays.
- `rna_assay`: RNA assay name.
- `atac_assay`: Chromatin assay name.
- `rna_layer`: RNA count layer used for TF-gene inference and AUC scoring.
- `atac_layer`: ATAC count layer used for peak-gene correlations.
- `backend`: Runtime backend. "python" reads or extracts official SCENIC+ result tables and remains the default. "cpp" runs the approximate package workflow.
- `allow_approximate`: Whether to allow the approximate C++ workflow. This must be TRUE when backend = "cpp".
- `grn_method`: GRN method used for TF-gene inference. The C++ workflow can call RunGRNBoost2(), RunGENIE3(), or RunGNIPLR(); RegDiffusion and GNIPLR are supported through the Python backend.
- `regulators`: Candidate transcription factors. If NULL, motif TF names are used when available; otherwise all RNA genes are considered.
- `rna_expr`: Optional expression matrix used for C++ TF-gene and region-gene inference. Rows should be genes and columns should be cells; a cell-by-gene matrix is accepted and transposed when cell names make the orientation unambiguous.
- `atac_expr`: Optional accessibility matrix used for C++ region-gene inference. Rows should be regions and columns should be cells; a cell-by-region matrix is accepted and transposed when cell names make the orientation unambiguous.
- `tf_gene_prior`: Optional precomputed TF-gene table with columns TF, target, and importance. When supplied with backend = "cpp", C++ GRN inference is skipped and the table is used as the TF-gene evidence layer.
- `region_gene_prior`: Optional precomputed region-gene table with columns region, gene, and score. When supplied with backend = "cpp", C++ peak-to-gene correlation is skipped.
- `tf_region_prior`: Optional precomputed TF-region table with columns TF, region, and score. When supplied with backend = "cpp", existing motif incidence is not required.
- `triplets_prior`: Optional precomputed TF-region-gene table with columns TF, region, gene, and score. When supplied with backend = "cpp", triplets are read directly instead of assembled from the three edge layers.
- `eregulons_prior`: Optional precomputed eRegulon table with columns regulon and target. When supplied with backend = "cpp", eRegulon names and gene sets are taken from this table.
- `auc_expr`: Optional expression matrix used only for eRegulon AUCell scoring in the C++ workflow. Rows should be genes and columns should be cells; a cell-by-gene matrix is accepted and transposed when cell names make the orientation unambiguous.
- `auc_rankings`: Optional precomputed 0-based ranking matrix used only for eRegulon AUCell scoring in the C++ workflow. Rows should be cells and columns should be genes; a gene-by-cell matrix is accepted and transposed when cell names make the orientation unambiguous. This is mainly useful for official SCENIC+ parity tests because SCENIC+ uses seeded random tie-breaking.
- `region_gene_window`: Maximum peak-to-gene distance in base pairs.
- `region_gene_search_space`: Optional search-space table with columns region/Name and gene/Gene. When supplied, C++ region-gene scoring is limited to these candidate pairs.
- `region_gene_method`: C++ region-gene scoring method. "gbm" follows the official SCENIC+ region-to-gene strategy more closely by combining boosting feature importance with Spearman correlation; "correlation" keeps the older correlation-only approximation.
- `region_gene_n_rounds`: Number of boosting rounds for C++ region-gene importance scoring.
- `max_region_gene`: Maximum region-gene links retained per gene.
- `max_tf_region`: Maximum motif-supported regions retained per TF.
- `min_eregulon_size`: Minimum genes per eRegulon retained for AUC scoring.
- `egrn_rho_threshold`: Absolute Spearman correlation threshold used to split TF-gene and region-gene links into activating/repressing eGRN modules.
- `egrn_quantiles`: Region-gene importance quantiles used to build candidate eModules before TF-gene leading-edge filtering.
- `egrn_top_n_region_gene`: Top-N region-gene links per gene used as additional candidate eModules before TF-gene leading-edge filtering.
- `egrn_min_target_genes`: Minimum leading-edge target genes required for an eRegulon module. The default follows the official SCENIC+ CLI workflow.
- `group.by`: Optional metadata column used to calculate eRegulon specificity scores.
- `grn_top_targets`: Maximum TF-gene edges retained per target. The default Inf keeps all positive links to match arboreto GRNBoost2 output.
- `max_grn_targets`: Maximum genes used as TF-gene GRN targets in the C++ workflow. With grn_target_scope = "region_gene", genes are ranked by strongest absolute peak-to-gene correlation. Set to Inf to keep the full selected target universe.
- `grn_target_scope`: TF-gene target universe for the C++ workflow. "all" follows official SCENIC+ TF-to-gene inference by scoring every RNA gene; "region_gene" restricts TF-gene inference to genes with peak links.
- `grn_n_rounds`: Number of C++ tree boosting rounds for TF-gene inference. The default follows arboreto SGBM_KWARGS.
- `grn_learning_rate`: C++ tree boosting learning rate.
- `grn_max_depth`: Maximum depth of each C++ TF-gene regression tree.
- `grn_max_features`: Fraction of candidate TFs sampled at each C++ tree split.
- `grn_subsample`: Fraction of cells sampled for each C++ boosting round.
- `grn_early_stop_window_length`: Out-of-bag improvement window used for C++ GRNBoost2 early stopping. The RunSCENICPlus default is 0, which disables early stopping to match official SCENIC+ SGBM_KWARGS.
- `seed`: Random seed used by the C++ stochastic boosting code. The default matches official SCENIC+ command-line wrappers.
- `cores`: Number of workers used by C++ TF-gene GRN inference.
- `assay_name`: Assay used to store eRegulon AUC scores.
- `tool_name`: Name of the srt@tools result entry.
- `python_result_dir`: Directory containing official SCENIC+ outputs already exported as tf_gene, region_gene, tf_region, triplets, eregulons, and auc tables. Used only for backend = "python".
- `scplus_object`: Optional official SCENIC+ Python object path (.pkl/.pickle) to extract into python_result_dir before standardization. Used only for backend = "python".
- `envname`: Python environment used when backend = "python".
- `conda`: Conda-compatible executable used when backend = "python".
- `verbose`: Whether to print the message. Default is TRUE.
