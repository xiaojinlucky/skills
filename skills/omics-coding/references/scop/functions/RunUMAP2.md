```

## Parameters

- `object`: An object. This can be a Seurat object, a matrix-like object, a Neighbor object, or a Graph object.
- `...`: Additional arguments to be passed to UMAP.
- `reduction`: Which dimensionality reduction to use. Default is "pca".
- `dims`: The dimensions to be used. Default is NULL.
- `features`: A character vector of features to use. Default is NULL.
- `neighbor`: The name of the Neighbor object to be used. Default is NULL.
- `graph`: The name of the Graph object to be used. Default is NULL.
- `assay`: Which assay to use. If NULL, the default assay of the Seurat object will be used. When the object also contains ChromatinAssay, the default assay and additional ChromatinAssay will be preprocessed sequentially.
- `layer`: Which layer to use. Default is data.
- `umap.method`: The UMAP method to be used. Options are "naive" and "uwot". Default is "uwot".
- `reduction.model`: A DimReduc object containing a pre-trained UMAP model. Default is NULL.
- `n_threads`: Num of threads used.
- `return.model`: Whether to return the UMAP model. Default is FALSE.
- `n.neighbors`: A number of nearest neighbors to be used. Default is 30.
- `n.components`: A number of UMAP components. Default is 2.
- `metric`: The metric or a function to be used for distance calculations. When using a string, available metrics are: euclidean, manhattan. Other available generalized metrics are: cosine, pearson, pearson2. Note the triangle inequality may not be satisfied by some generalized metrics, hence knn search may not be optimal. When using metric.function as a function, the signature must be function(matrix, origin, target) and should compute a distance between the origin column and the target columns. Default is "cosine".
- `n.epochs`: A number of iterations performed during layout optimization for UMAP. Default is 200.
- `cores`: The spread parameter for UMAP, used during automatic estimation of a/b parameters. Default is 1.
- `min.dist`: The minimum distance between UMAP embeddings, determines how close points appear in the final layout. Default is 0.3.
- `set.op.mix.ratio`: Interpolate between (fuzzy) union and intersection as the set operation used to combine local fuzzy simplicial sets to obtain a global fuzzy simplicial sets. Both fuzzy set operations use the product t-norm. The value of this parameter should be between 0.0 and 1.0; a value of 1.0 will use a pure fuzzy union, while 0.0 will use a pure fuzzy intersection.
- `local.connectivity`: The local connectivity, used during construction of fuzzy simplicial set. Default is 1.
- `negative.sample.rate`: The negative sample rate for UMAP optimization. Determines how many non-neighbor points are used per point and per iteration during layout optimization. Default is 5.
- `a`: The parameter a for UMAP optimization. Contributes to gradient calculations during layout optimization. When left at NA, a suitable value will be estimated automatically. Default is NULL.
- `b`: The parameter b for UMAP optimization. Details see parameter a.
- `learning.rate`: The initial value of "learning rate" of layout optimization. Default is 1.
- `repulsion.strength`: A numeric value determines, together with alpha, the learning rate of layout optimization. Default is 1.
- `reduction.name`: The name of the reduction to be stored in the Seurat object. Default is "umap".
- `reduction.key`: The prefix for the column names of the UMAP embeddings. Default is "UMAP_".
- `verbose`: Whether to print the message. Default is TRUE.
- `seed.use`: Random seed for reproducibility. Default is 11.
