## Summary

3D-Dimensional reduction plot for gene expression visualization.

## Signature

```text
FeatureDimPlot3D( srt, features, reduction = NULL, dims = c(1, 2, 3), axis_labs = NULL, split.by = NULL, layer = "data", assay = NULL, calculate_coexp = FALSE, pt.size = 1.5, cells.highlight = NULL, cols.highlight = "black", shape.highlight = "circle-open", sizes.highlight = 2, width = NULL, height = NULL, save = NULL, force = FALSE, verbose = TRUE )
```

## Parameters

- `srt`: A Seurat object.
- `features`: A character vector or a named list of features to plot. Features can be gene names in Assay or names of numeric columns in meta.data.
- `reduction`: Which dimensionality reduction to use. If not specified, will use the reduction returned by DefaultReduction.
- `dims`: Dimensions to plot, must be a two-length numeric vector specifying x- and y-dimensions
- `axis_labs`: A character vector of length 3 indicating the labels for the axes.
- `split.by`: Name of a column in meta.data column to split plot by. Default is NULL.
- `layer`: Which layer to use. Default is data.
- `assay`: Which assay to use. If NULL, the default assay of the Seurat object will be used. When the object also contains ChromatinAssay, the default assay and additional ChromatinAssay will be preprocessed sequentially.
- `calculate_coexp`: Whether to calculate the co-expression value (geometric mean) of the features.
- `pt.size`: The size of the points in the plot. Default is NULL, which automatically scales point diameter with the square root of the number of plotted cells while keeping a readable minimum size of 0.3. Automatically sized raster plots use at least a two-pixel radius at the reference raster.dpi = c(512, 512). Point sizes are scaled with raster.dpi, so their relative appearance remains stable when the raster resolution changes. Non-raster point sizes use fixed physical units; increase pt.size proportionally when exporting to an unusually large canvas.
- `cells.highlight`: A logical or character vector specifying the cells to highlight in the plot. If TRUE, all cells are highlighted. If FALSE, no cells are highlighted. Default is NULL.
- `cols.highlight`: Color used to highlight the cells.
- `shape.highlight`: Shape of the cell to highlight. See https://plotly.com/r/reference/scattergl/#scattergl-marker-symbol{scattergl-marker-symbol}
- `sizes.highlight`: Size of highlighted cell points.
- `width`: Width in pixels, defaults to automatic sizing.
- `height`: Height in pixels, defaults to automatic sizing.
- `save`: The name of the file to save the plot to. Must end in ".html".
- `force`: Whether to force drawing regardless of the number of features greater than 100. Default is FALSE.
- `verbose`: Whether to print the message. Default is TRUE.
