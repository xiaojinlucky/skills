## Summary

Run Scissor phenotype-associated cell selection

## Signature

```text
RunScissor( srt, bulk_dataset, phenotype = NULL, condition.by = NULL, positive = NULL, assay = NULL, bulk_assay = "counts", layer = "counts", features = NULL, family = c("gaussian", "binomial", "cox"), backend = c("cpp", "r"), alpha = NULL, cutoff = 0.2, tag = NULL, graph = NULL, dims = 1:10, nfeatures = 2000, seed = 123, prefix = "Scissor", tool_name = "Scissor", store_inputs = FALSE, verbose = TRUE )
```

## Parameters

- `srt`: A Seurat object containing single-cell expression data.
- `bulk_dataset`: A bulk expression matrix-like object or a SummarizedExperiment. Rows are genes and columns are bulk samples.
- `phenotype`: Phenotype annotation for bulk samples. For family = "binomial", character or factor values are converted to 0/1 according to positive. If NULL and bulk_dataset is a SummarizedExperiment, condition.by is used.
- `condition.by`: Column in colData(bulk_dataset) used as phenotype when phenotype = NULL.
- `positive`: Positive phenotype level for binomial Scissor. If NULL, the second sorted level is used.
- `assay`: Which assay to use. If NULL, the default assay of the Seurat object will be used. When the object also contains ChromatinAssay, the default assay and additional ChromatinAssay will be preprocessed sequentially.
- `bulk_assay`: Assay name used when bulk_dataset is a SummarizedExperiment.
- `layer`: Assay layer used from srt.
- `features`: Optional genes used before intersecting bulk and single-cell features.
- `family`: Regression family passed to Scissor.
- `backend`: Scissor backend. "r" calls the upstream package path and "cpp" uses the optimized scop path. Legacy aliases "original" and "scop" are accepted as "r" and "cpp", respectively.
- `alpha`: Scissor alpha search values. If NULL, Scissor's default grid is used.
- `cutoff`: Maximum selected-cell fraction used by Scissor's alpha search.
- `tag`: Optional phenotype labels for printed/stored summaries.
- `graph`: Existing Seurat graph used by the "cpp" backend. If NULL, an assay SNN graph or RunStandardWorkflow() graph is reused when present, otherwise a temporary Scissor-like graph is built.
- `dims`: PCA dimensions used when a temporary graph is built.
- `nfeatures`: Number of variable features used when a temporary graph is built.
- `seed`: Random seed used by Scissor's alpha loop.
- `prefix`: Prefix for metadata column names.
- `tool_name`: Name of the srt@tools entry.
- `store_inputs`: Whether to store Scissor regression inputs in srt@tools. Default is FALSE to avoid large objects.
- `verbose`: Whether to print the message. Default is TRUE.

```

## Description

Run Scissor phenotype-associated cell selection

## Value

A Seurat object with Scissor status and coefficient columns in metadata and a Scissor result bundle in srt@tools[[tool_name]].

## Examples

```r
data(panc8_sub)
data(islet_bulk)
panc8_sub <- RunStandardWorkflow(panc8_sub, verbose = FALSE)
panc8_sub <- RunScissor(
  panc8_sub,
  bulk_dataset = islet_bulk,
  condition.by = "condition",
  positive = "bfa",
  family = "binomial",
  features = head(
    intersect(
      rownames(panc8_sub),
      rownames(SummarizedExperiment::assay(islet_bulk, "counts"))
    ), 1000
  ),
  alpha = 0.2,
  cutoff = 0.5
)

ScissorPlot(
  panc8_sub,
  xlab = "UMAP_1",
  ylab = "UMAP_2"
)
```
