## Summary

Run common cell-cell communication analyses

## Signature

```text
RunCCC( srt, group.by, methods = c("CellChat", "CellphoneDB", "LIANA"), method_params = list(), backend = c("cpp", "r"), skip_failed = FALSE, rebuild_unified = TRUE, thresh = 0.05, verbose = TRUE )
```

## Parameters

- `srt`: A Seurat object.
- `group.by`: Name of one or more meta.data columns to group (color) cells by.
- `methods`: Registered cell-cell communication methods to run. The default core methods are "CellChat", "CellphoneDB", and "LIANA". NicheNet, MultiNicheNet, SpatialCellChat, and MDIC3 can be selected when their design-specific arguments are supplied through method_params. LIANA's default internal method set includes its CellPhoneDB scorer, so standalone CellphoneDB and LIANA consensus results are not statistically independent evidence.
- `method_params`: Named list of method-specific arguments passed to the corresponding wrapper. For example, use method_params$CellphoneDB$pvalue for CellphoneDB-specific parameters.
- `backend`: Backend used only for result post-processing and unified CCC table aggregation. The upstream CellChat, CellphoneDB, and LIANA inference logic is unchanged.
- `skip_failed`: Whether to keep running remaining methods if one method fails.
- `rebuild_unified`: Whether to rebuild srt@tools[["CCC"]] from the completed methods after all requested methods finish.
- `thresh`: Significance threshold used when rebuilding unified CCC tables and passed to RunCellChat() unless overridden in method_params$CellChat.
- `verbose`: Whether to print the message. Default is TRUE.
