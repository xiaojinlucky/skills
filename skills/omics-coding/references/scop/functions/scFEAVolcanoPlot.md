## Summary

Plot scFEA flux Cohen's d volcano plots

## Signature

```text
scFEAVolcanoPlot( srt, group.by, ident.1 = NULL, ident.2 = NULL, assay = "scFEAflux", layer = "data", label_by = c("reaction", "module", "module_reaction"), pathways = NULL, p_adj_cutoff = 0.001, cohen_cutoff = 0.2, combine = TRUE, width = 12, height = 10.4, verbose = TRUE )
```

## Parameters

- `srt`: A Seurat object returned by [RunscFEA()].
- `group.by`: Metadata column defining groups. If `ident.1` and `ident.2` are both `NULL`, each group is compared against all remaining cells.
- `ident.1, ident.2`: Group names to compare. Cohen's d is `mean(ident.1) - mean(ident.2)` divided by pooled standard deviation. If both are `NULL`, one-vs-rest contrasts are generated automatically.
- `assay`: Flux assay name.
- `layer`: Flux assay layer.
- `label_by`: Label mode for significant pathway modules.
- `pathways`: Optional `SM_anno` classes to plot.
- `p_adj_cutoff`: Adjusted p-value cutoff for highlighting, labels, and the horizontal threshold line.
- `cohen_cutoff`: Absolute Cohen's d cutoff for highlighting, labels, and the vertical threshold lines.
- `combine`: Whether to combine pathway plots into 2 x 2 paged panels. If `FALSE`, returns one plot per pathway.
- `width, height`: Suggested export size. Stored as attributes on the returned plot object.
- `verbose`: Whether to print messages.

## Usage

```text
scFEAVolcanoPlot( srt, group.by, ident.1 = NULL, ident.2 = NULL, assay = "scFEAflux", layer = "data", label_by = c("reaction", "module", "module_reaction"), pathways = NULL, p_adj_cutoff = 0.001, cohen_cutoff = 0.2, combine = TRUE, width = 12, height = 10.4, verbose = TRUE )
```

## Description

Plot scFEA flux Cohen's d volcano plots

## Value

For a single contrast, a paged list of `ggplot` objects when `combine = TRUE`, otherwise a named list of pathway `ggplot` objects. Statistics are stored in the `"data"` attribute. For automatic one-vs-rest mode, a named list of single-contrast results is returned and combined statistics are stored in the outer `"data"` attribute.
