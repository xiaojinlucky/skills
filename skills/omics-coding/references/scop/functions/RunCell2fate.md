# Run Cell2fate RNA velocity analysis

## Summary

Run the official Python Cell2fate model on raw spliced and unspliced counts from a Seurat object. Cell2fate uses an isolated Python 3.9 environment because its upstream dependency stack is not compatible with the default scvi-tools environment. Inputs, model files, posterior output, logs, and a reproducible manifest are persisted under result_dir. A returned object can be passed back to the function for a matching resumed run. Output previously recorded by the same tool_name and prefix is replaced in the returned copy; unrelated metadata or tool entries are never overwritten.

## Signature

```text
RunCell2fate( srt, result_dir, spliced_assay = "spliced", unspliced_assay = "unspliced", spliced_layer = "counts", unspliced_layer = "counts", cluster.by, features = NULL, remove_clusters = NULL, cells_per_cluster = 100L, min_shared_counts = 10L, n_var_genes = 2000L, n_modules = NULL, model_params = list(), train_params = list(max_epochs = 500L, batch_size = 1000L, train_size = 1, lr = 0.01, accelerator = "auto"), posterior_params = list(num_samples = 30L, batch_size = NULL, use_gpu = FALSE, return_samples = FALSE), seed = 1L, envname = NULL, resume = TRUE, overwrite = FALSE, prefix = "Cell2fate", tool_name = "Cell2fate", store_velocity = FALSE, verbose = TRUE )
```

## Parameters

- `srt`: A Seurat object containing raw spliced and unspliced counts.
- `result_dir`: Empty directory, or a directory owned by an earlier RunCell2fate() run, used to persist inputs, model files, posterior output, per-attempt logs, and the run manifest.
- `spliced_assay, unspliced_assay`: Assays containing raw spliced and unspliced counts.
- `spliced_layer, unspliced_layer`: Raw-count layers in the corresponding assays.
- `cluster.by`: Metadata column containing cell-state labels used for Cell2fate training-data selection.
- `features`: Optional features to consider before Cell2fate filtering and variable-gene selection.
- `remove_clusters`: Optional cluster labels to remove before training.
- `cells_per_cluster`: Maximum cells retained per cluster. Use NULL to retain every cell. Cells excluded by this sampling receive NA posterior values and FALSE in the generated <prefix>_selected metadata column.
- `min_shared_counts`: Minimum total shared spliced and unspliced counts required for a gene.
- `n_var_genes`: Number of variable genes retained for model fitting.
- `n_modules`: Number of Cell2fate modules. If NULL, the upstream get_max_modules() heuristic is used.
- `model_params`: Named arguments passed to Cell2fate_DynamicalModel().
- `train_params`: Named arguments passed to the model train() method.
- `posterior_params`: Named arguments passed to export_posterior() through its sample_kwargs argument.
- `seed`: Random seed used by Python, NumPy, PyTorch, and scvi-tools.
- `envname`: Name of the isolated Cell2fate environment. If NULL, "cell2fate_env" is used.
- `resume`: Reuse a completed run only when its input fingerprint, parameters, and artifact hashes match.
- `overwrite`: Permit replacement of incompatible artifacts in an owned result_dir.
- `prefix`: Prefix used for Cell2fate metadata columns. Existing columns without matching Cell2fate provenance are rejected.
- `tool_name`: Name of the srt@tools result entry. An existing unrelated entry is rejected.
- `store_velocity`: Whether to write the dense posterior velocity matrix to CSV and read it into srt@tools. The posterior .h5ad, including its velocity layer, is always retained on disk.
- `verbose`: Whether to print the message. Default is TRUE.

## Description

Run the official Python Cell2fate model on raw spliced and unspliced counts from a Seurat object. Cell2fate uses an isolated Python 3.9 environment because its upstream dependency stack is not compatible with the default scvi-tools environment. Inputs, model files, posterior output, logs, and a reproducible manifest are persisted under result_dir. A returned object can be passed back to the function for a matching resumed run. Output previously recorded by the same tool_name and prefix is replaced in the returned copy; unrelated metadata or tool entries are never overwritten.

## Value

A Seurat object with Cell2fate time, uncertainty, module activation, module-state, and training-cell-selection metadata. Cells not selected for training have NA posterior values. Detailed provenance and optional velocity values are stored in srt@tools[[tool_name]].

## Examples

```r
\dontrun{
data(pancreas_sub)
pancreas_sub <- RunCell2fate(
  pancreas_sub,
  result_dir = "pancreas_cell2fate",
  cluster.by = "SubCellType",
  n_modules = 10
)
FeatureDimPlot(pancreas_sub, "Cell2fate_time")
}
```
