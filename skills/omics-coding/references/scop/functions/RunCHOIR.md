## Summary

Runs the optional CHOIR backend on a single-modality Seurat object. CHOIR builds and prunes a hierarchical clustering tree using random-forest classifiers and permutation tests to identify statistically distinct cell populations. The upstream CHOIR records remain available in srt@misc[[key]]. This wrapper also writes a stable cluster column to cell metadata and a lightweight summary to srt@tools[[tool_name]].

## Signature

```text
RunCHOIR( srt, assay = NULL, layer = NULL, key = "CHOIR", cluster_colname = "CHOIR_cluster", tool_name = "CHOIR", alpha = 0.05, p_adjust = c("bonferroni", "fdr", "none"), feature_set = c("var", "all"), exclude_features = NULL, n_iterations = 100, n_trees = 50, min_accuracy = 0.5, max_clusters = "auto", normalization_method = c("none", "SCTransform"), batch.by = NULL, batch_correction_method = NULL, reduction = NULL, var_features = NULL, atac = FALSE, n_cores = 1, seed = 1, store_tool = TRUE, verbose = TRUE, overwrite = FALSE, ... )
```

## Parameters

- `srt`: A Seurat object.
- `assay`: Assay used by CHOIR. If NULL, the default assay is used.
- `layer`: Assay layer used by CHOIR. If NULL, "data" is used for RNA and sketch assays, and "scale.data" is used for SCT and integrated assays. Other assays require an explicit layer.
- `key`: Name used by CHOIR to store its complete results in srt@misc.
- `cluster_colname`: Metadata column used for the final CHOIR clusters.
- `tool_name`: Name used to store the SCOP result summary in srt@tools.
- `alpha`: Significance level used for CHOIR permutation tests.
- `p_adjust`: Multiple-testing correction used by CHOIR.
- `feature_set`: Whether CHOIR random forests use variable or all features.
- `exclude_features`: Features excluded from CHOIR random forests.
- `n_iterations`: Number of bootstrap iterations for each permutation test.
- `n_trees`: Number of trees in each random forest.
- `min_accuracy`: Minimum classifier accuracy required to keep clusters separate.
- `max_clusters`: Must be "auto". Numeric limits are rejected because the pinned upstream backend can fail to terminate when the number of clusters plateaus.
- `normalization_method`: Normalization performed inside CHOIR. Use "none" for previously normalized data or "SCTransform" with a counts layer. The pinned backend does not support "SCTransform" for Seurat v5 Assay5 objects.
- `batch.by`: Optional metadata column containing batch labels.
- `batch_correction_method`: Batch correction performed by CHOIR. If NULL, "Harmony" is selected when batch.by is supplied and "none" otherwise.
- `reduction`: Optional existing dimensional reduction supplied to CHOIR. This can be a reduction name in srt or a cell-by-dimension matrix.
- `var_features`: Features associated with reduction. If NULL and a reduction is supplied, variable features from assay are used.
- `atac`: Whether the selected assay contains ATAC-seq data.
- `n_cores`: Number of cores used by CHOIR. The pinned backend supports macOS and Linux; Windows execution is rejected before installation.
- `seed`: Random seed passed to CHOIR.
- `store_tool`: Whether to store a lightweight result summary in srt@tools[[tool_name]].
- `verbose`: Whether to print progress messages.
- `overwrite`: Whether to replace existing CHOIR metadata, reduction, and misc entries, plus the tools entry when store_tool = TRUE.
- `...`: Additional named arguments passed to the installed CHOIR entry point. Unsupported arguments produce an error rather than being silently ignored.

## Usage

```text
RunCHOIR( srt, assay = NULL, layer = NULL, key = "CHOIR", cluster_colname = "CHOIR_cluster", tool_name = "CHOIR", alpha = 0.05, p_adjust = c("bonferroni", "fdr", "none"), feature_set = c("var", "all"), exclude_features = NULL, n_iterations = 100, n_trees = 50, min_accuracy = 0.5, max_clusters = "auto", normalization_method = c("none", "SCTransform"), batch.by = NULL, batch_correction_method = NULL, reduction = NULL, var_features = NULL, atac = FALSE, n_cores = 1, seed = 1, store_tool = TRUE, verbose = TRUE, overwrite = FALSE, ... )
```

## Description

Runs the optional CHOIR backend on a single-modality Seurat object. CHOIR builds and prunes a hierarchical clustering tree using random-forest classifiers and permutation tests to identify statistically distinct cell populations. The upstream CHOIR records remain available in srt@misc[[key]]. This wrapper also writes a stable cluster column to cell metadata and a lightweight summary to srt@tools[[tool_name]].

## Value

A Seurat object containing CHOIR clusters in cluster_colname, complete upstream records in srt@misc[[key]], and, when store_tool = TRUE, a lightweight summary in srt@tools[[tool_name]].

## Examples

```r
\dontrun{
if (check_r("corceslab/CHOIR", verbose = FALSE)) {
  data(pancreas_sub)
  pancreas_sub <- Seurat::NormalizeData(pancreas_sub, verbose = FALSE)
  pancreas_sub <- RunCHOIR(
    pancreas_sub,
    assay = "RNA",
    n_cores = 2,
    verbose = FALSE
  )
  CellDimPlot(pancreas_sub, group.by = "CHOIR_cluster")
}
}
```
